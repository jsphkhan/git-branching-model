This project is a dummy project which is a GIT repo
This is where I am trying Github Branching models
I will create feature branches, add features and merge to develop
develop is the default branch. Forked out of master
From develop we create RLS branch to release features. 
RLS tags are created when RLS branch's PR is merged with master
